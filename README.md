# Mini Ruby (and some JavaScript) Challenges from Project Euler.

This repo is a collection of one-file basic ruby programs. I am completing these files for practice in logic and algorithms.

Starting on problem number 5, I start committing the thought process running through my head in the form of commits, so if you follow my commit flow, you'll see how I break the problems down.

Problems Completed:<br/>
**1.** Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. (Ruby)<br/>
**2.** Find the sum of the even-valued fibonacci terms whose values do not exceed four million. (Ruby)<br/>
**3.** What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143? (done in both Ruby and Javascript. The Ruby version takes way too long -- need to refactor)<br/>
**4.** Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers (done in JavaScript)<br/>
**5.** Find the the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20? (Ruby)<br/>
